# that is, multiple joined rows share the same order and thus the same subtotal value
# say an order has 3 order items where their sum of (quantity Ã— item_id.price) meets the criteria (its subtotal exceeds 30)
# so we can have a pointer to these 3 pointers (3 full joined rows), call this pointer order_pointer
# map this order_pointer to its subtotal value, and based on which, we can sort in bulk (assume insertion sort as we traverse through the orders of the same customer, and then traversing through the rest of the customers)
